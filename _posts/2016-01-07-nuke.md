Hidden in the sleepy underground below the mountain pass on the border 
between Poland and Czech Republic, this mine is a real gem for the 
adventure loving souls. Discovered after Second World War it was 
exploited during 50-60s years of the past century to support Soviet 
Union nuclear program. In the 70s Uranium was exhausted, and the mine 
was turned into Radon spa - inhalatorium. Radon vapor deceased in 1989\. 
Since then the mine was closed and forgotten up to 2014, when is open 
for public. More pictures from this fascinating, apocalyptic and 
surreal place telling stories about the Cold War from behind the Iron 
Curtain can be seen here [http://www.kopalniapodgorze.pl/index.html][0] as well as some info about opening hours and 
entrance prices.
