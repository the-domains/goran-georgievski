In this wide open field placed among the post glacial lakes one of the largest battles in the Medieval Europe takes place - The Battle of Grunwald or the First Battle of Tannenberg. It was fought on 15 July 1410 between Polish-Lithuanian Union against the Teutonic order. Various estimates of opposing forces ranging from about 10000 up to almost 200000 armed men. Polish-Lithuanian victory marked the rise of the Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania alliance. Together with their vassal states it becomes the dominant political and military force in the region spreading between the Baltic and the Black Sea. The battle was the source of many romantic stories, myths and legends, serving the national pride in resistance to Germanization and Russification, taking part during the domination of foreign Empires in Poland and Lithuania.
