            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>My 2015 highlights </h1><p>It’s the end of the year and the begging of the new one. It’s time to contemplate our achievements from the past year and think about the New Year resolutions. And what is the best place to look at past year then to the photos made during the last year? That said, but also having in mind thought of the master of photography, Ansel Adams:
“ Twelve significant photographs in any one year is a good crop.”
I was trying to select my top 12 photos from the last year. However, probably due to lack of high quality criteria, I found even more than 12. They are not of that high quality that masters in photography expect from the top 12 photographs of the year but they’ve made my year.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/054286653a0a81438f23efbccb44ee400cfc302f.jpg"></article>]]></description>
